    "1. Download and plot 3 apparently related sets of data with at least. Each set should contain at least two related variables. You should explain *how* variables in each set of data are related. Plot each set using the scatter plot function *and* the line graph function. For example, you might the obseved rate of unemployement and the natural rate of unemployment in the same graph. To find data, search for data at FRED and use the code associated with the data. For example, the [CPI measure that includes urban items](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL) is identified by the code, *CPIAUCSL*.\n",

    "2. Create a correlation matrix for quarterly observations of Nominal GDP, Real GDP, the Price Level (CPI or GDP Deflator), the quantity of currency in circulation and the federal funds rate for as large of a date range as possible. Then, calculate the year-over-year percent change for each each variable and save the results as variables in the same dataframe. Create a correlation matrix for these new variables.\n",

    "How has the correlation between each variable changed? Why do you think the correlation changes after calculate the year-over-year percent change?\n"
